# functions = Function is a block of code only executed when called
# 'def' define a function
# 'def x():' simple function example.

def hello(first_name, second_name,age):
    print("hello! "+ first_name +" "+ second_name)
    print("You're "+ str(age)+ " years old!")



hello("Slice", "one", 21)
# To call the function
# We can send our function some information ex. x(something)

# now that we have made the str we write name into hello() so that name = 'slice'
# we can also do it like this:

# We can send more than one value
